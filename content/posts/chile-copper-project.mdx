# Project Overview

We recently completed a major installation for one of Chile's largest copper processing facilities. The client faced significant bottlenecks in their manual packing process, which couldn't keep up with their increased production capacity.

## The Challenge

- **High Labor Costs**: Manual packing required 4 operators per shift.
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Manual wrapping led to variable protection levels.
- **Safety Concerns**: Heavy coil handling posed risks to workers.

## The Solution

We designed a fully automated coil packing line integrating:

1. Automatic centering station
2. Through-eye wrapping machine
3. Automatic stacking system
4. Palletizing robot

## Results

After implementation, the facility achieved:

- **300% efficiency increase**
- **Zero safety incidents** in the first 6 months
- **Standardized packaging** meeting export requirements
