Details supply information

Switching Cabinets

The electrical devices are installed on mounting plates in closed cabinets, protection degree IP20, designed in form 1 based on EN 60439-1. Each cabinet has a designation label on the door with the appropriate location indicator.

Cabinets with the following dimensions are mainly used:

Width: 800 or 1,200 mm, depth: 600 mm, height: 2200 mm, base 200mm

The switching cabinets are installed in a switching cabinet row.

For transport the cabinet system can be separated into shipping units with a maximum width of 3600 mm.

The subdivision of the individual cabinets is made according to their respective functions:

Feed

Control voltage generation, auxiliary drive 

Main drive

Control

Cooling of the Switch gear

By fans cooling

Lighting of the Switch gear

Lighting for the switch gear is provided by a lamp combination with outlet built into every other switching cabinet.

Safety Coverings

The used components are protected against accidental contact. Additional endanger components under voltage are covered with transparent covers and warning labels in all transformers, fuses, breakers and copper tracks, etc.

Wiring

The wiring is flexible for all control circuits and lies in covered cable conduits. Attention is given that these cable conduits are filled only up to 70% with wires. The wire color codes and diameters conform to EN 60204.

Terminal Strips

The terminal strips are mounted approximately 250 mm from the lower edge of the switching cabinets.

The terminal strips have labels showing their respective terminal strip number. Each individual terminal is given a terminal number corresponding to the wiring diagram.

Cable stop bars are installed to prevent excessive tension on the outgoing cables.

Identification labels

Each device in the switching cabinet is provided with an adhesive label indicating the designation of the module in the wiring diagram.

Wire Identification

Identification of the individual wires is necessary for the internal wiring in the switching cabinets.

The identification of the incoming and outgoing cables and lines is designed in such a way that they can always be read without detaching the connections or removing the cable stop clamps. The individual wires of a cable can be identified by the terminal number of the connection point. The cable can be identified by its cable number.

Motor drives

For the motors, where we use three-phase asynchronous motors, the basic specifications of the drives is :

Wide range of adjustable speeds

Speed to zero without reduction of the torque

External air-cooling fans

Durable

Transmitter for registering the motor speed

Terminal box for connecting of power cables

Motor temperature monitoring 

 AUTOMATIZATION CONFIGURATION

Plant Control 

The complete plant will be controlled trough manual input on dedicate remote/local control desk and foot switch. 

Visualization System

The monitoring of the system will be realized with the software WinCC and will be installed by using the following operator panels: 

The visualization essentially includes the following:

The supervision system can be connected to the plant controller 

Machine cabling

The machine cabling conforms to effective regulations. The cables are laid in conduits in the concrete foundation of the line. 

When exposed and in hazardous positions the cables are placed in hoses in top of the concrete.

The existing termination switches, magnetic valves are connected directly to the bus modules installed in the terminal boxes/substations.

Power cables

Direct cabling is between the individual motors and the wiring cabinets. Regulated drives with frequency inverter with shielded cables.
