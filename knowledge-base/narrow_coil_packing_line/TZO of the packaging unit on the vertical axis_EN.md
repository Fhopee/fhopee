Introduction

These Terms of Reference (hereinafter the "TOR") shall make the basis for the development of technical and commercial offers for the supply of engineering and main process equipment for vertical-axis (eye to the sky) coil packing line.

The purpose of the project is to provide for the packaging of grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) coil semis for shipment to the NIC site in a vertical position. 

The project will be implemented in one stage. The design capacity of the line shall ensure coil packing in the quantity of at least 80 thousand tonnes per year, at least 6 thousand tonnes per month.

The coil packing line shall be designed for the mechanised packing of semi-finished coils produced at the Cold Rolling Shop (CRS) of VIZ Steel, positioned eye to the sky, for further containerizing of packed coils and subsequent shipment to India.

Process equipment shall be supplied complete with electrical equipment, automated control system, hydraulic, pneumatic and other equipment.

Some technical requirements may be revised by the Buyer in the process of development.

Current status

Presently, semi-product coils are packaged while positioned horizontally (eye to the side) in two stages (to prevent coil collapsing, a cylindrical steel sleeve is inserted inside the coils).

First stage - internal packing: coils positioned horizontally are strapped through the inner diameter at the existing packing machine.

Second stage - external packing: manual coil packing with external packing elements and placing them on wooden supports until they are ready to be containerized. 

The existing packing machine provides for the packing of coils in the horizontal-axis position only, there is no possibility of packing the coils positioned vertically.

The purchased (new) line will be installed at the site being prepared for it and will be integrated into the existing production process. The new line will replace (fully or in part) the existing "horizontal" packing machine.

The project does not include the upgrade or revamping of the existing "horizontal" packing machine due to significant design differences.

Appendix 1

Basic requirements for the APCS

Requirements for the system configuration and functioning

The automation system (AS) shall be designed as a set of unified automation components integrated into complete functional modules. A complex of functional modules integrated with one another form the automation system.

Components and modules of automation systems directly involved in the performance of regulation and/or control functions shall belong to one of the three levels of functional hierarchy:

– Level 0 (field level) – it includes the components that interact directly with the controlled process and/or mechanisms of the facility: sensors, actuators, drives and their communications.

– Level 1 (APCS hardware) is designed for automatic and automated process control, collection and processing of process snapshots, computing and generation of commands and their transmission to actuators. The hardware that belongs to this level usually executes a set of real-time automatic control circuits with feedback as well as logic circuits that control the execution of operations by corresponding mechanisms/devices in compliance with safety requirements, and visualization tools and operator's control tools. The hardware of this level performs functions indirectly through Level 0 components.

- Level 2 (facility/line control) stands for modules executing the functions related to the production process of the facility as a whole: monitoring the flow of material to be processed, management of the pre-set values ​​(set points) and processing modes, collection and recording of process data, set up and adaptation of applied mathematical models, communication with MES (Manufacturing Executive System) level, etc. The hardware of this level usually does not have to have direct access to Level 0 hardware and have direct impact on the process, performing all its functions only through interaction with Level 1.

Apart from the functional components and modules, the AS shall also include the following service (infrastructural) subsystems:

– Human-machine interface (HMI) - the means of displaying the current state of a controlled process to the operator and providing the operator with necessary controls (including control panels and pulpits). The components that belong to this category are capable of interacting with any functional module.

- Process data networks - a set of systems that provide for the transfer of necessary data between components (modules) both within the AS, and between automation and information systems.

Modules shall communicate with one another via standardized open interfaces of two possible types:

– analogue interfaces that transmit information in the form of physical signal values ​​(voltage, current, etc.);

– network communication: transmitting information in digital form using dedicated process data networks.

Inter-module interfaces should predominantly be based on universal standardized data networks (preferably, Ethernet-based technologies: Profinet, TCP/IP, EtherCAT, Ethernet/IP, etc.) or physical discrete signal lines.

All components of the automation systems to be introduced shall support standard operability in the routed networks based on Ipv4 protocol.

Static IP-addressing  shall be used. Use of DHCP shall be allowed in exceptional cases, if using static IP-addressing prevents from project implementation.

The networks to be designed (upgraded) shall be integrable with the existing network infrastructure and compatible with the network solutions that the company uses. For this purpose, process networks shall be designed according to the specifications for connection available upon request from the Process Automation Division of NLMK.

At all design stages the documentation shall undergo an expert review of the compliance of offered architectural solutions and implemented APCS components with the requirements of the Technical Policy.

Requirements for process network structure

2.1 Process networks deployed as part of automation systems are divided into the following categories:

– field buses - isolated fragments of networks to ensure data exchange between Level 1 and Level 0 components;

– Level 1 networks - isolated networks to ensure data exchange between the modules of Level 1, Level 2 and HMI;

– HMI networks - networks for communication between HMI workstations with HMI servers and Level 2 servers.

The configuration and list of automation networks deployed for a facility/line shall be determined in the course of engineering. Nonetheless, Level 1 network shall be available for all units.

2.2 Field buses shall be completely isolated from other networks and from each other, and, as a rule, arranged within one AS module. The architecture of field buses shall exclude the possibility of unauthorized physical connection to them as much as practicable. The following devices connect to field buses:

– control devices (PLC, master computers);

– built-in operator panels;

– remote I/O (RIO) devices;

– Level 0 instrumentation, controls and automation (sensors, actuators, discrete panels, etc.)

– power converters for variable speed drives

Wireless technologies are generally not allowed for field buses. If there are any objective reasons (e.g. the need to exchange data with a moving object), wireless solutions may be used provided that a study of how to prevent any unauthorized connection is carried out. Such wireless segments have to be fully isolated from all other networks.

2.3 Networks of Level 1 are defined at each individual facility/line (AS module). If feasible, on one facility several dedicated segments of networks of Level 1 may be arranged which are to be routed (at the level of TCP/IP) within one facility. 

Level 1 networks shall be completely isolated from other networks. They are usually hosted within one AS module. Depending on the structure of the automation system, the following devices shall be connected to Level 1 networks:

– control devices (PLC, master computers);

– automation devices requiring direct network communication with controlling devices:  visualization servers, process control servers (Level 2), data archiving servers (e.g., IBA PDA), engineering stations, data gateways, integrated operator panels, visualization stations in Stand Alone design;

– Level 0 physical instrumentation and controls (if there are no individual field buses or it is impractical to provide them).

Structures with ring topology and independent transmission media routes shall be used as main architecture for building Level 1 networks. The number of network structural nodes in one ring shall be limited (to approximately 10-25). To ensure fail-free operation, high-speed redundancy protocols (MRP, Hiper Ring, EPSR and the like) shall be used. Spanning Tree protocols (STP, RSTP, MSTP, etc.) shall not be allowed in Level 1 networks.

Connection of program computer components (servers, gateways, etc.) to networks of Level 1 shall be implemented via dedicated network interfaces.

Wireless technologies for building Level 1 networks shall not be allowed. If reasonably required, wireless connections should be implemented in the form of dedicated field buses and in such cases the matter of unauthorized access prevention shall be investigated.

2.4 HMI networks (networks of Level 2) shall be distinguished as part of major automation systems using SCADA client-server architecture as well as when applying AS virtualization solutions. The following devices get connected to HMI networks:

– local network printers that interact with operator stations and/or thin clients at control pulpits;

– network interfaces of servers and virtual automation machines providing for functioning of operator stations and/or data communication to higher levels;

– interfaces of data collection gateways interacting with automation system servers.

To ensure back-up at each pulpit, it is required to provide for availability of at least two switches. 

HMI networks of each facility/line shall be stand-alone; however, routing (on IP level) may be used at shop level to interconnect individual HMI networks.

HMI network can be arranged in two ways:

– a separate system of HMI switches integrated in a physically isolated network;

– common system of L1/HMI switches split into logically isolated virtual sub-networks (VLAN).

The selection of the way will be made at the design stage depending on the system size, intensity of network traffic, and requirements for delay stability. As a rule, it is advisable to organise a dedicated HMI network when there are more than 10 operator stations.

A separate system of HMI switches shall ensure failure safety by using redundant communication links and critical network devices. The redundancy option based on the Spanning Tree protocols is the least preferred, and its feasibility shall be determined at the design stage. The scope of the network covered by this protocol shall not exceed 8-10 devices. Media transmission routes shall be independent.

2.5 The newly designed and upgraded process networks of Level 1 and HMI shall be integrated into the existing network and information infrastructure. For this purpose, at the engineering stage, the designer company shall request technical specifications for connection to the Customer's network.
