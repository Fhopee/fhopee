Switching Cabinets
The electrical devices are installed on mounting plates in closed cabinets, protection degree IP20,
designed in form 1 based on EN 60439-1. Each cabinet has a designation label on the door with the
appropriate location indicator.
Cabinets with the following dimensions are mainly used:
Width: 800 or 1,200 mm, depth: 600 mm, height: 2200 mm, base 200mm
The switching cabinets are installed in a switching cabinet row.
For transport the cabinet system can be separated into shipping units with a maximum width of
3600 mm.
The subdivision of the individual cabinets is made according to their respective functions:
o Feed
o Control voltage generation, auxiliary drive
o Main drive
o Control
Cooling of the Switch gear
By fans cooling

## 第 16 页

Lighting of the Switch gear
Lighting for the switch gear is provided by a lamp combination with outlet built into every other
switching cabinet.
Safety Coverings
The used components are protected against accidental contact. Additional endanger components
under voltage are covered with transparent covers and warning labels in all transformers, fuses,
breakers and copper tracks, etc.
Wiring
The wiring is flexible for all control circuits and lies in covered cable conduits. Attention is given
that these cable conduits are filled only up to 70% with wires. The wire color codes and diameters
conform to EN 60204.
Terminal Strips
The terminal strips are mounted approximately 250 mm from the lower edge of the switching
cabinets.
The terminal strips have labels showing their respective terminal strip number. Each individual
terminal is given a terminal number corresponding to the wiring diagram.
Cable stop bars are installed to prevent excessive tension on the outgoing cables.
Identification labels
Each device in the switching cabinet is provided with an adhesive label indicating the designation
of the module in the wiring diagram.
Wire Identification

## 第 17 页

Identification of the individual wires is necessary for the internal wiring in the switching cabinets.
The identification of the incoming and outgoing cables and lines is designed in such a way that they
can always be read without detaching the connections or removing the cable stop clamps. The
individual wires of a cable can be identified by the terminal number of the connection point. The
cable can be identified by its cable number.
Motor drives
For the motors, where we use three-phase asynchronous motors, the basic specifications of the
drives is :
Wide range of adjustable speeds
Speed to zero without reduction of the torque
External air-cooling fans
Durable
Transmitter for registering the motor speed

using the following operator panels:
The visualization essentially includes the following:
o The supervision system can be connected to the plant controller
Machine cabling
The machine cabling conforms to effective regulations. The cables are laid in conduits in the
concrete foundation of the line.
When exposed and in hazardous positions the cables are placed in hoses in top of the concrete.
The existing termination switches, magnetic valves are connected directly to the bus modules
installed in the terminal boxes/substations.
Power cables
Direct cabling is between the individual motors and the wiring cabinets. Regulated drives with
frequency inverter with shielded cables.
