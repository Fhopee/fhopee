 Straps width 31.75mm（32mm）
 Single head
 The heads position -top of the coil
 Radial strapping
 Moveable
Special features
 The whole machine meets CE standard, with stable and reliable quality. The core
strapping head is imported from Germany, the quality of key components is guaranteed,
the loss of spare parts is low, and the installation and maintenance is convenient and
simple.
 Rugged and reliable design - the whole machine is designed for continuous high load
operation in steel coil slitting mill.
 Fast strapping speeds, low mechanical wear, automatic adaptation to different coil sizes,
no need to set coil parameters.
 Pre-feed feature - At the end of each bale, the machine automatically feeds the 2nd bale
to a position on the feeder rail, thus saving the next feed time.
 Rigorous testing of the machine before shipment - As part of our quality control
program, the machine is fully assembled and tested in our factory to ensure reliability.
 The machine head utilizes two strap drive systems (dual servo motor drives) with
separate feed and take-up and tensioning units to further increase stability and
redundancy and ensure precise control of speed and force. The feed pulleys are
pressurized on the strapping belt by a pneumatic cylinder to maintain a balanced feed
and take-up force.
 The strapping head creates up to 22,000N of tension, with precisely adjustable tension,
which allows for strong bundling, tailing of coils, and utilizes the elongation of the steel
strapping to prevent breakage of loose bundles.
 The head mounting position is easy for maintenance. Pneumatic motors, cylinders, and
control valves are standardized for lower maintenance costs. Laser 2D code on the
machine head parts for quality control traceability.
 Optimized design for quick disassembly of main wearing parts.
 .In order to avoid the debris of steel strapping from accumulating in the nip unit and
damaging the parts, the strapping head has the function of blowing debris to eliminate
the impurities in the nip unit.
 The arrow guide groove enables the machine to realize non-complete outer surface of
the bundle, which is convenient for the complex situation of the bundle and the machine
translation.
 The 500 kg class vertical belt feeder with extra large rolls increases efficiency, reduces
downtime for belt changes and reduces waste of belt ends.

Switching Cabinets
The electrical devices are installed on mounting plates in closed cabinets, protection degree IP20,
designed in form 1 based on EN 60439-1. Each cabinet has a designation label on the door with
the appropriate location indicator.

## 第 13 页

13
Cabinets with the following dimensions are mainly used:
Width: 800 or 1,200 mm, depth: 600 mm, height: 2200 mm, base 200mm
The switching cabinets are installed in a switching cabinet row.
For transport the cabinet system can be separated into shipping units with a maximum width of
3600 mm.
The subdivision of the individual cabinets is made according to their respective functions:
o Feed
o Control voltage generation, auxiliary drive
o Main drive
o Control
Cooling of the Switch gear
By fans cooling
Lighting of the Switch gear
Lighting for the switch gear is provided by a lamp combination with outlet built into every other
switching cabinet.
Safety Coverings
The used components are protected against accidental contact. Additional endanger components
under voltage are covered with transparent covers and warning labels in all transformers, fuses,
breakers and copper tracks, etc.
Wiring
The wiring is flexible for all control circuits and lies in covered cable conduits. Attention is given
that these cable conduits are filled only up to 70% with wires. The wire color codes and
diameters conform to EN 60204.
Terminal Strips
The terminal strips are mounted approximately 250 mm from the lower edge of the switching
cabinets.
The terminal strips have labels showing their respective terminal strip number. Each individual
terminal is given a terminal number corresponding to the wiring diagram.
Cable stop bars are installed to prevent excessive tension on the outgoing cables.
Identification labels
Each device in the switching cabinet is provided with an adhesive label indicating the
designation of the module in the wiring diagram.
Wire Identification

## 第 14 页

14
Identification of the individual wires is necessary for the internal wiring in the switching
cabinets.
The identification of the incoming and outgoing cables and lines is designed in such a way that
they can always be read without detaching the connections or removing the cable stop clamps.
The individual wires of a cable can be identified by the terminal number of the connection point.
The cable can be identified by its cable number.
Motor drives
For the motors, where we use three-phase asynchronous motors, the basic specifications of the
drives is :
Wide range of adjustable speeds
Speed to zero without reduction of the torque
External air-cooling fans
Durable
Transmitter for registering the motor speed
Terminal box for connecting of power cables
Motor temperature monitoring
AUTOMATIZATION CONFIGURATION
Plant Control
The complete plant will be controlled trough manual input on dedicate remote/local control desk
and foot switch.
Visualization System
The monitoring of the system will be realized with the software WinCC and will be installed by
using the following operator panels:
The visualization essentially includes the following:
o The supervision system can be connected to the plant controller
Machine cabling
The machine cabling conforms to effective regulations. The cables are laid in conduits in the
concrete foundation of the line.
When exposed and in hazardous positions the cables are placed in hoses in top of the concrete.
The existing termination switches, magnetic valves are connected directly to the bus modules
installed in the terminal boxes/substations.
