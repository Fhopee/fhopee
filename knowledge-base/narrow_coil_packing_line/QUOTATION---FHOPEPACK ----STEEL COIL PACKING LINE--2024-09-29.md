Switching Cabinets
The electrical devices are installed on mounting plates in closed cabinets, protection degree IP20,
designed in form 1 based on EN 60439-1. Each cabinet has a designation label on the door with the
appropriate location indicator.
Cabinets with the following dimensions are mainly used:
Width: 800 or 1,200 mm, depth: 600 mm, height: 2200 mm, base 200mm
The switching cabinets are installed in a switching cabinet row.
For transport the cabinet system can be separated into shipping units with a maximum width of 3600 mm.
The subdivision of the individual cabinets is made according to their respective functions:
o Feed
o Control voltage generation, auxiliary drive
o Main drive
o Control
Cooling of the Switch gear
By fans cooling
Lighting of the Switch gear
Lighting for the switch gear is provided by a lamp combination with outlet built into every other
switching cabinet.
Safety Coverings
The used components are protected against accidental contact. Additional endanger components under
voltage are covered with transparent covers and warning labels in all transformers, fuses, breakers and
copper tracks, etc.
Wiring
The wiring is flexible for all control circuits and lies in covered cable conduits. Attention is given that
these cable conduits are filled only up to 70% with wires. The wire color codes and diameters conform to
EN 60204.
Terminal Strips

## 第 18 页

18
The terminal strips are mounted approximately 250 mm from the lower edge of the switching cabinets.
The terminal strips have labels showing their respective terminal strip number. Each individual terminal is
given a terminal number corresponding to the wiring diagram.
Cable stop bars are installed to prevent excessive tension on the outgoing cables.
Identification labels
Each device in the switching cabinet is provided with an adhesive label indicating the designation of the
module in the wiring diagram.
Wire Identification
Identification of the individual wires is necessary for the internal wiring in the switching cabinets.
The identification of the incoming and outgoing cables and lines is designed in such a way that they can
always be read without detaching the connections or removing the cable stop clamps. The individual
wires of a cable can be identified by the terminal number of the connection point. The cable can be
identified by its cable number.
Motor drives
For the motors, where we use three-phase asynchronous motors, the basic specifications of the drives is :
Wide range of adjustable speeds
Speed to zero without reduction of the torque
External air-cooling fans
Durable
Transmitter for registering the motor speed
Terminal box for connecting of power cables
Motor temperature monitoring
AUTOMATIZATION CONFIGURATION
Plant Control
The complete plant will be controlled trough manual input on dedicate remote/local control desk and
foot switch. Communication protocol should be TCP/IP based
Visualization System
The monitoring of the system will be realized with the software WinCC and will be installed by using the
following operator panels:

## 第 19 页

19
The visualization essentially includes the following:
o The supervision system can be connected to the plant controller
Machine cabling
The machine cabling conforms to effective regulations. The cables are laid in conduits in the concrete
foundation of the line.
When exposed and in hazardous positions the cables are placed in hoses in top of the concrete.
The existing termination switches, magnetic valves are connected directly to the bus modules installed in
the terminal boxes/substations.
Power cables
Direct cabling is between the individual motors and the wiring cabinets. Regulated drives with frequency
inverter with shielded cables.
PLANNING, DOCUMENTATION
Generation of the following documents:
o Wiring diagram in CAD system
o Terminal diagram
o Control panel diagram
o Program STEP7 on CD
Painting specification
The Painting must be realized according to clients needs.
